    <h3>StatisProCardFactory (SPCF)</h3>
    <p>StatisProCard Factory was created to help you generate player/pitcher cards for the venerable tabletop baseball simulation...Statis-Pro Baseball.</p>
    <p>I owned Statis-Pro when I was 12 years old but never played it much since my friends owned APBA. In 2015, I re-discovered the game and I've been hooked ever since. </p>

    <p>Big thanks to Jim Barnes (creator of Statis-Pro) for allowing the game to live on long after both he and Avalon Hill ceased publishing.</p>
